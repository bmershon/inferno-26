*Back to the sources*.

This assignment followed my [first assignment](https://github.com/bmershon/inferno-translations) for Martin Eisner's course on Dante's Divine Comedy at Duke Universtiy during the Fall 2014 semester.

This assignment tasked students with engaging sources surrounding the material presented in Dante Alighieri's *Inferno*. I chose to discuss the goings on of *Inferno* 26.
